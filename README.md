# PizzaMenu

**PizzaMenu** is a C#/.NET application designed to simulate a digital pizza ordering system. Users can browse pizzas, customize size, crust, and toppings, manage their cart, apply coupons, and confirm orders. It also includes an admin panel to manage menu items, categories, and offers.

## Features

* Cart & Checkout – Add, update, or remove items, with tax and delivery fee calculation
* Discounts & Coupons – Apply promo codes for discounts
* Order Summary & Invoice – Generates detailed order information
* Admin Panel – Manage pizzas, categories, toppings, and promotions
* Search & Filter – Find pizzas by name, category, or price range
* Persistence – Save orders and menu data (File/SQLite/SQL Server depending on implementation)

## Tech Stack

* Language: C#
* Framework: .NET (Console / WinForms / WPF / ASP.NET Core – depending on implementation)
* Database: SQLite / SQL Server / Entity Framework Core (optional)
* Architecture: Clean layered approach – Domain, Services, Data, UI
